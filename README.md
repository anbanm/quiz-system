## 🏗️ Modular Architecture (v1.4.0)

The quiz system now features a **completely modular architecture** with 73% code reduction and enhanced maintainability:

### 📦 Module Overview
- **🔧 `quiz-loader.js`** (189 lines) - Module system with validation and dependency checking
- **⚙️ `quiz-utils.js`** (225 lines) - Utility functions for format conversion and calculations  
- **📝 `quiz-richtext.js`** (367 lines) - Quill.js integration for mathematical formulas
- **💾 `quiz-data.js`** (722 lines) - Data management, import/export, and test library
- **🎨 `quiz-ui.js`** (646 lines) - UI components, dialogs, and rendering
- **❓ `quiz-questions.js`** (374 lines) - Question CRUD operations and management

### 🌐 Global Namespace Pattern
```javascript
window.QuizModules = {
    Loader: { registerModule, validateAPI, initializeModules },
    Utils: { deltaToHtml, convertAnswerFormats, getDifficultyColor },
    RichText: { initializeQuillEditor, getQuestionContent },
    Data: { loadTestLibrary, saveTestLibrary, generateJSON },
    UI: { renderQuestions, showSuccessDialog, toggleSidebar },
    Questions: { addOrUpdateQuestion, editQuestion, deleteQuestion }
};
```

### ✅ Benefits Achieved
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns across focused modules
- **Testability**: Each module can be tested independently with isolated APIs  
- **Reusability**: Modules can be used in other projects following the same patterns
- **Debuggability**: Module-specific logging and error handling
- **Offline-First**: Global namespace ensures compatibility without ES6 imports
